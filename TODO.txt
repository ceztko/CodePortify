TODO
====

- Port to VS 2012;
- Allows to *not* perform Tabify/Untabify or new line normalization;
- Tabify/Untabify pasted text;
- Allows the configuration to be totally a user setting (saving in ".user" and ".suo"
  files), optionally allowing the setting to be persisted in the main project/solution
  file, that is now the default (except for exclusions).
- Clean Menu Commands icons, the margin bar UI, according to the modifications;
- Better uninstall registry restore;
- (Maybe) Optionally configure UTF-8 with BOM or other custom encoding;
- (Maybe) Untabify/Tabify text after first indentation.
